#  Bank Kata (Technical Test for Skypay)

This project is my solution for the Bank Kata technical test as part of my application for the **QA and Test Automation Engineer position at Skypay**.
The goal was to implement a simple bank account system while applying **Mockist principles** and **acceptance testing with Cucumber**.

---

## Objectives and Constraints

This implementation adheres to the following requirements:

### ðŸ”¹ Implement a class Account that conforms to the given interface
### ðŸ”¹ Use Mockist approach to drive the architecture and validate interactions with dependencies.
### ðŸ”¹ Simulate bank statement printing via a mocked StatementPrinter class.
### ðŸ”¹ Write JUnit and Cucumber tests to validate functionality and ensure non-regression.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot** for application framework
- **Maven for dependency management**
- **JUnit 5 for unit testing**
- **Mockito for mocking dependencies**
- **Cucumber for BDD-style acceptance testing**
- **IntelliJ IDEA for development and test execution**
